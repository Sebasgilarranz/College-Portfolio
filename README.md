# College-Portfolio

Hi there! Welcome to my college portfoilio. Here you can find some of the homework assignemnts and projects I completed throughtout my college career.

## Computer Science 1
This was an introductory course on data structures and the design and analysis of algorithms. We developed formal, mathematical techniques for analyzing algorithms in terms of time and space efficiency. We worked on our problemsolving skills by designing and implementing efficient solutions to problems in C. We also covered recursion, common data structures (such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, binary heaps, and hash tables),sorting techniques, and search algorithms. 

All assignements are written in the C programming language.

### Glowworm
This program is a worm that begins with a tail and head, '~' and 'G' respectively. It takes in a maximum size of worm and a string which will make it grow or shrink. More information can be found in the assignment pdf in the glowworm folder. The purpouse of the assignment is to refresh on C knowledge and work with manipulating string. More information can be found in the assignment PDF in the Glowworm folder.

### KindredSpirits
This program checks two binary trees and determine if they were "kindred spirits." Essentially this was to check if the preorder traversal of the left tree is the same as the postorder traversal of the right tree. This purpose of this assignement was to learn to work with binary trees and learn how to traverse them with different methods. More information can be found in the assignment PDF in the KindredSpirits folder.

### ListyString
This program takes in a string and to convert it to a linked list. After converting, we take in different commands which will manipulate the linked list according to the command description. The purpose of this assignment was to learn to create and manipulate linked list in C. It also helped gain I/O experience in C and process command line arguments. More information can be found in the assignment PDF in the ListyString folder.

### LonelyPartyArray
This program keeps track of multiple different arrays which are dynamically allocated in an effort to conserve memory. This program helped gain expirience with dynamically allocating memory in C rather than allocating mememory all at once and wasting memory. More information can be found in the assignment PDF in the LonelyPartyArray folder.

### SneakyRooks
This program takes in a list of coordinate strings for rooks on a chess board, and determines if any of the rooks can attack one another. The trickiest part of this assignement is that the runtime cannot exceed O(m+n) So it must be linear. More information can be found in the assignment PDF in the LonelyPartyArray folder.

## Computer Science 2
This was an advanced course on data structures and the design and analysis of algorithms. We developed formal, mathematical techniques for analyzing algorithms in terms of time and space efficiency. We trained our problemsolving skills by designing and implementing efficient solutions to problems in Java. We will also cover recursion,data structures (such as trees (including binary search trees, AVL trees, 2-4 trees, and/or B-trees), skip lists, hashtables, graphs, and a small sampling of probabilistic data structures), sorting algorithms, graph algorithms, and avariety of problem solving techniques including backtracking, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, and dynamicprogramming.

All the assignments are written in the Java programming language.

### GenericBST
This assignment was to modify a source file BST.java into a generic java class. This allows us to create a binary search true using whatever data type we want. More information about this assignment can be found in the assignment PDF in the GenericBST folder.

### RunLikeHell
This program is recursive solution to take in a 1D array, and find the combinitation with the highest integer value when adding them up. The biggest thing to consider is that you cannot take two integers next to each other. More information about this assignment can be found in the assignment PDF in the RunLikeHell folder.

### SkipList
This program is a probabilistic skip list, that has insertion, deletion, and search operation, all while bieng generic. More information about this assignment can be found in the assignment PDF in the SkipList folder.

https://github.com/Sebasgilarranz/Computer-Science-2/tree/main/SkipList
### SneakyKnights
This program checks to see if, with a list of given coordinates, any of the knights are able to attack one another. The tricky part about the assignment is that it must not exceed O(nk) where n is the number of knights and k is the max length of thier coornidate strings. More information about this assignment can be found in the assignment PDF in the SneakyKnights folder.

https://github.com/Sebasgilarranz/Computer-Science-2/tree/main/SneakyKnights
### SneakyQueens
This program checks to see if, with a list of given coordinates, any of the queens are able to attack one another. The tricky part about the assignment is that it must not exceed O(m+n). More information about this assignment can be found in the assignment PDF in the SneakyKnights folder.

https://github.com/Sebasgilarranz/Computer-Science-2/tree/main/SneakyQueens
### TopoALLlogical
This program uses backtracking to find all of the topological sorts for a given graph. I takes in a list of |V| numbers and finds |V|! valid topoligcal sorts. The program must no worse than O(|V|^2). More information about this assignment can be found in the assignment PDF in the TopoALLlogical folder.

https://github.com/Sebasgilarranz/Computer-Science-2/tree/main/TopoALLgical
### TopoPaths
This program determines how many topopaths there are in a given arbitrary graph.(A topopath is an ordering of vertices that are a valid path in a grpah and a valid topological sort.) The solution must be O(|V|^2). More information about this assignment can be found in the TopoPaths folder.
